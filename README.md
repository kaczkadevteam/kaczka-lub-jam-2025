# The Art of Blow  

*In a world where hygiene is key, one baby holds the soapy fate of us all...*  

## ðŸ§¼ The Lore  
A *madka* (aka an overzealous Facebook mom) leaves her precious *bombelek* (baby) in a sandbox. The twist? This kiddo's chomped down on a bar of soap and now fends off germs with an endless supply of bubbles. Germs bewareâ€”Bombelekâ€™s bubbly arsenal is here to save the day!

## ðŸŽ® Core Gameplay  

### **The Bubble Spawner**  
Bombelek (our bubble-powered hero) is chilling in the middle of the arena, pumping out soap bubbles to battle dirt, viruses, and bacteria. Use the mutations dropped by the enemies to strengthen yourself!

#### ðŸ’Ž Spawner Upgrades:  
- Faster spawn rate  
- Multiple spawners! (more bombeleks = more chaos)  

#### ðŸ’Ž Bubble Upgrades:  
- Zoomy bubbles (speed boost)  
- Lasting bubbles (longer lifespan)  
- *Thicc* bubbles (larger size)  

---

### **The Air Blower**  
Your weapon of choice! Aim and blow those bubbles at approaching enemies by rotating the blower (it always faces the spawner, so no 360 trick shots).  

#### ðŸ’Ž Blower Upgrade:  
- Faster rotation speed for quick bubble tactics.

### **The Enemies**  
Enemies crawl into the arena from the edges, all with one goal: ruin Bombelekâ€™s vibes. Smack â€˜em with bubbles to score points and snag upgrades!  

#### ðŸ’€ Enemy Types:  
- **Viruses**: Fast, unpredictable, and prone to mutating (*bigger, faster, stronger vibes*).  
- **Bacteria**: Slow but sneakyâ€”they replicate if you donâ€™t pop â€˜em fast enough.  
- **Dirt**: The basic baddies. No gimmicks, just chilling and being annoying.  

---

### **Cleanness (HP)**  
Your hygiene score (aka health). The dirtier the arena gets, the closer you are to game over. Keep things squeaky clean, or itâ€™s curtains for Bombelek!

Now go forth, master the art of blowing, and show those germs whoâ€™s boss! ðŸ«§
